LAMS, the Label Artist Management System, was designed to give Record Labels and/or Artist Management organizations an easy way to contain all information regarding Artists' they manage, any they would like to sign, and manage Deals & Partnerships acquired for their signed artists.

This one stop shop platform keeps all of this vital data easily accesible either on mobile device or laptop/desktop computer. As a user, you can add, edit, and delete anything you manage! Admins are able to manipulate items sitewide and re-assign Artist Managers if need be.
